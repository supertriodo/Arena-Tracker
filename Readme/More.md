Arena Tracker reads the Hearthstone log to give you all the info you need. Arena Tracker works in Arena, Standard, Wild, Adventures and Tavern Brawl, but it was created from the ground up with arena players in mind.

Arena Tracker is free and open source. To support its development, I have created a [Patreon account](https://www.patreon.com/triodo) which will unlock the full potential of this tracker for 3â‚¬ a month, the premium version.

Below is a brief overview of its features divided into free and premium versions of the tracker. For more details you can take a look at the [User Guide](https://triodo.gitbook.io/arena-tracker-documentation/en).
