Arena Tracker reads the Hearthstone log to give your all the info you need. Arena Tracker works in arena, constructed, adventures and tavern-brawl, but it was created from the ground with arena players in mind.

Arena Tracker is free and open source. To support its development I have created a [patreon account](https://www.patreon.com/triodo) which will put in your hands the full potential of this tracker for 3$ a month.

Next you can check a brief explanation of its features divided in free and patreon versions of the tracker. For a more extended explanation you can take a look at the [user guide](https://arena-tracker.gitbooks.io/arena-tracker-documentation/content/en/).
